# MARIOFont
The Mario fonts you usually see in Mario games. Currently this repo has: `MARIO_Font_v3_Solid.otf` and `MARIOMAKER.otf`

## MARIO_Font_v3_Solid.otf

The UI (time and score) and logo font in most Super Mario series.  
This file is found in **Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash**, and again is used in **Super Mario Run**.  
It supports basic Latin, full Hiragana and Katakana, some Kanjis, and some Cyrillic characters.

This is a custom font created by Fontworks and Nintendo holds the rights to it. Latest version is v3.005 on 5/25/2011.

## MARIOMAKER.otf

This is the official font of Super Mario Maker 2, used in its logo and most of the UI. Version 1.3, last updated on 11/28/2018. Extracted from [yuzu emulator](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu), and decompressed from [WOFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format) to its original format, OTF.

**Mario Maker vs. Mario Maker 2 font**  
In Super Mario Maker, the font is called `MARIO30th` instead (found in [SCHOLASTIC's Super Mario Maker 3DS PDF](http://www.scholastic.com/nintendo/gamedesign/pdfs/fullteacherguide.pdf)).  
`MARIO30th` apparently lacks lowercase characters [or it is available? - probably just for `amiibo` word](https://youtu.be/_9W_y8IlNro?t=400), which is then added in `MARIOMAKER.otf`.
