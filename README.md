The Mario Font you usually see in Mario games.  
This file is found in **Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash**, and again is used in **Super Mario Run**. The image is just a demo for the font, actual font looks different because the image is a recreation of the font by others.  
It supports basic Latin, full Hiragana and Katakana characters, some Kanjis, Russian (?) characters.

This is a custom font created by Fontworks and Nintendo holds the rights to it. Latest version is v3.005 on 5/25/2011.
